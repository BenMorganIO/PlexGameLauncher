# Plex Game Launcher
---
### What the heck is this thing?

This is an emulator launcher frontend for Plex Media Center for numerous consoles (see Supported Consoles below)

### What is required?

- A Mac
- Plex Media Server
- Plex Home Theater OR Plex Media Center

### How do I set it up?

####### Note to users of old game launcher: this will probably nuke your current game launcher instance and completely reset your configuration and will require you to reconfigure after installing or to move your ROMs to the new ROMs directory inside of your Documents folder.

To install, paste the following into your OS X terminal, press enter, and type in your password when prompted:

######## ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CamHenlin/PlexGameLauncher/master/autoinstall.rb)"

There is a new ROMs directory inside of your Documents folder. There is a folder for every console, simply drop your ROMs in to those folders, restart Plex Media Server, reopen Plex Media Center, navigate to Videos, and open Game Launcher. Once in game launcher, and before playing any games, you will need to navigated to the maintenance section and have the Game Launcher search for ROMs, which may take several minutes. After that, you're ready to go!
